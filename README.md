The files for my new HTML+CSS front site : https://openaurore.ddns.net/

# Presentation
This website acts as the front page of my Websites. This is a card based design inspired by the Discord profile card. My bias to create this website was to use a minimal design with 80's neon-like colors coming from the graphic charter of my main project, The OpenAurore Project, and stark contrasts. Yet, I wanted this page to present several important informations about me : my name and username, a short description about my job, my localization as well as the name of the project I'm working on, a link to my <a href="https://projects-openaurore.ddns.net/"> Wordpress portfolio </a> and a link to contact me and, finally, some of my skills.

# RE-USE
You like my project and you want to re-use my code and my pictures ? Please, consider showing my nickname as well as a link to my <a href="https://openaurore.ddns.net/"> website </a> somewhere visible on the page.
